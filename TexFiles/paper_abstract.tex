This paper introduces to  the topic of Commitment-Schemes, a two party kryptographic primitive and summarizes it. 

The aim of commitment schemes is to provide a mechanism for party A to commit to a hidden value and reveal it if necessary. Party B can confirm that the revealed value and the hidden value match.

~\newline This paper first introduces to the topic itself, a hash-based implementation, the \textit{pedersen-commitments} which are based on the discrete logarithm and commitments based on quadratic residues. 

In conclusion a case-study of commitments for one-time authorization in a distributed web-application is provided.
